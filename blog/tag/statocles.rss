                <p><a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">Static site generators</a> are popular these
days. For small sites, the ability to quickly author content using simple tools
is key. The ability to use lower-cost (even free) hosting, often without any
dynamic capabilities, is good for trying to maintain a budget. For larger
sites, the ability to serve content quickly and cheaply is beneficial, and
since most pages are read far more often than they are written, generating a
full web page to store on the filesystem can improve performance (and lower
costs).</p>

<p>For me, I like the convenience of using <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>
to host project-oriented websites. The project itself is already on Github, so
why not keep the website closely tied to it so it doesn&#39;t get out-of-date? For
an organization like <a href="http://chicago.pm.org">the Chicago Perl Mongers</a>, Github
can even host custom domains, allowing easy collaboration on websites.</p>

<p>It&#39;s through the Chicago.PM website that I was introduced to Octopress, a
blogging engine built on Jekyll. It&#39;s through using Octopress that I decided to
write my own static site generator,
