            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>This year, I resolve to:</p>

<h2>1) Blog more</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve got dozens of blog posts waiting to be published. Time to publish them.
I&#39;ve got dozens of ideas for blog posts waiting to be written.  Time to write
them. I&#39;ve got monthly column ideas. Time to implement them.</p>

<h2>2) Cook more, and blog about it</h2>

<p>Two birds with one stone! I need to try new things in food, no matter how
popular they are. I have trouble talking about things that interest me, because
I take criticism too personally, and I have an intense need to be liked and
praised.</p>

<h2>3) Make a video game</h2>

<p>Playing the new Soda Crush Saga game reminded me of why I want to create video
games. There is no substitute for actually building things. Ideas must be
tested. Implementing ideas leads to new ideas. Ideas are cheap.</p>

<h2>4) Open up</h2>

<p>(i.e. blog about personal things). I&#39;m back to my old, completely-closed-off
self. I stare at the ground when walking from place to place to avoid eye
contact with anyone. I don&#39;t share my feelings with anyone, especially when I&#39;m
upset. I bury everything, because I have this idea that nobody wants to hear
about the things I&#39;m upset about. It turns out, those people aren&#39;t my friends.
I was right about that.</p>

<h2>5) Exercise</h2>

<p>I haven&#39;t been to the gym I&#39;m paying for in 6 weeks. Time to fix that. Time to
make my dream of a lean 180 a reality.</p>

<p>Writing blog posts satisfies my desire to do one thing on Github every day.
Making a video game will also satisfy that condition.</p>

<p>To make this all happen, I need to do a little every day.</p>
