We had our first project night at [Chicago.PM](http://chicago.pm.org) this
week, where we discussed ideas and wrote code for a Perl REPL GUI program
([App-Prima-REPL on Github](http://github.com/run4flat/App-Prima-REPL)) by
David Mertens built on [Prima](http://www.prima.eu.org/).

There were some small ideas to make the program more user-friendly, and some
larger ideas like an IRC client and guided tutorials based on the same format
that [http://perltuts.com](http://perltuts.com) uses.

I'm hoping that if I keep saying this, I'll be embarrassed into doing it: I
would really love to see the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) translated into
Perl (in spirit, if not in actual content). I've started writing down ideas for
chapters, but there is a lot of content to cover.

I added a `-I` flag and a `-M` flag to the `prima-repl` command-line launcher
that work as close to perl's flags as I could get. This is one of the things I
love about `prove` and `plackup:` Where it makes sense, they work like perl
does. So now the `prima-repl` can have subs and modules imported on the
command-line.

Altogether it was a wonderfully productive evening and I'm looking forward to
the next one.
